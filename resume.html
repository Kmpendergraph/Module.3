          <h3>ViewFinder Logo</h3>
          <img src="images/viewfinder.jpg" alt="Logo For Viewfinder App" style="width: 200px;" >
          <p>For this project, I had to create a logo for a fictional app of my choice. I decided to create a logo for an app made for photographers. The app is a map for photographers to find new locations to photograph at. For the logo design, I took inspriation from a viewfinder on a camera body and thought the name fit perfectly for the app as well since these photographers are looking for more "views" to "find".</p>

            <img src="images/cookbook.jpg" alt="Page Layout From Grandmas Kitche Cookbook" style="width: 200px;">
            <p>For this project, I created a cookbook full of family favorite recipies. My grandma always had crazy, but yuummy, recipies so I named it "Grandma's Kitchen" after her. This is a page layout from my personal favorite recipe.</p>

            <h3>Over Print Poster</h3>
            <img src="images/hats.jpg" alt="Graphic Designers Wear Many Hats Poster Design" style="width: 200px;">
            <p>For this project, I had to create a poster that graphic designers could relate to with an over print effect. I decided to base my project on the idea that graphic designers wear many hats. It is often that graphic designers are often called a million other names like, a photographer, a social media coordinator, a creative, and so much more. So, I thought this comment with the use of bright and fun colors would catch the attention of graphic designers.</p>
