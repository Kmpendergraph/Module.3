        <h2>Graphic Design Student</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is Kaitlyn Gray. I am so glad you found me! I am a graphic design student at Wake Technical Community College. I will graduate in Spring 2025 with an Associate’s degree in Applied Science. My graphic design inspiration is the NHL Carolina Hurricanes graphic design team.</p>
        <p>I will be graduating with six years of community college under my belt. I have had a passion for graphic design since high school but ultimately decided to go for a career path in healthcare right out of high school as it seemed more “realistic.” Many people have told me that it is hard to be successful in the graphic design career field. After about three years, I realized I needed to push for my dream and continue my passion for graphic design. And now, here I am today with only two semesters left!  </p>
        <p>To learn more about my work history, projects, and education, check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>. Thanks!</p>
